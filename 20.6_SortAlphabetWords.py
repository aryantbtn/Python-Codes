# Python Program to sort Words in Aplhabetical Order.
# In this program, we will learn to sort the words in alphabetical order using for loop and diaplay it.

'''String = "Smile! You are in Galgotias University."'''

# to take the input from the user then uncomment it
'''String = input("Enter the String: ")

# Here we will breakdown the string into a list of words.
words = [words.lower() for words in String.split()]

# now here we will sort the list
words.sort()
# print(words) # 1.Give same Input

# Now we will diaplay the sorted words.
print("The sorted words is: ")
for i in words:
    print(i)
# print(words)''' # 1.Give same Input
