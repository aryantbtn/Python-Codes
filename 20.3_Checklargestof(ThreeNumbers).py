# Python Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers.
# In this Program, you will learn to find the largest among three Numbers using if else and display it.

# Here the syntex for user defined input at the time of execuation.
'''A = float(input("Enter the 1st Number: "))
B = float(input("Enter the 2nd Number: "))
C = float(input("Enter the 3rd Number: "))'''\

# Pre defined values of 3 integers/float
'''A = 10
B = 52
C = 1'''

# Conditions:
'''if (A>=B) and (A>=C):
    largest = A
elif (B>=A) and (B>=C):
    largest = B
else:
    largest = C
print("The largest number is: ", largest)'''
