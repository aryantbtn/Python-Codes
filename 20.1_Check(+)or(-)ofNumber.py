# Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or 0
# In this example, we will learn to check whether a number entered by a user is positive, negative or zero. This problem is to solve using if...elif...else and nested if...else statement.

# THrough if...elif...else
'''Aryan = float(input("Enter a Number: "))
if Aryan>0:
    print("Yes, it is a Positive Number")
elif Aryan==0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Thus it is a Negative Number")'''


# Using the Nested if:
'''Aryan_Nested = float(input("Enter a Number: "))
if Aryan_Nested >= 0:
    if Aryan_Nested == 0:
        print("Number Written is Zero")
    else:
        print("Number is Positive")
else:
    print("Number is Negative")'''
